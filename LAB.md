# hapi-server

OPTIONAL BONUS: Use a Different Server Side Framework

Make a single resource REST API using a server side framework other than Express.

Use Mongoose same as with Express.

Consider:

Hapi
Restify
Koa (more challenging)
Anything else you can find on the interwebs...
Include a writeup comparing and contrasting your app with the apps you've built so far in vanilla Node and Express. Submit a link to the project repo, not a PR.
