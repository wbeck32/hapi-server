# hapi-server

This project is an implementation of an API route using a server besides. There are two routes here, post and get. Get returns a simple message and post saves an empty record into the mongoose database.

I started out using hapi but couldn't get it to work at all. I switched to restify and got it to work in Postman and in the browser but I couldn't get the mocha tests to work.
